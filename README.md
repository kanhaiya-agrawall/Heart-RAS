# Heart-RAS: Heart Disease Risk Assessment System

Heart-RAS is a machine learning-based system for predicting the risk of heart disease. It leverages a dataset of health parameters to assess an individual's risk and helps in early identification of potential heart-related issues.

## Features
- **Data-driven insights**: Uses health data like cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and more to predict heart disease risk.
- **Visualizations**: Provides insightful plots to visualize patterns and distributions in the dataset.
- **Machine learning models**: Employs various classification algorithms like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc., to predict heart disease risk.

## Dataset
The project uses a dataset consisting of health metrics that are commonly associated with heart disease risk factors. Ensure you have the CSV file for this data in the same directory as the notebook.

## Dependencies
Before running the notebook, you need to install the required dependencies:

\`\`\`bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
\`\`\`

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:

\`\`\`bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Heart-RAS.git
\`\`\`

2. Navigate into the project directory:

\`\`\`bash
cd Heart-RAS
\`\`\`

3. Run the Jupyter Notebook:

\`\`\`bash
jupyter notebook Heart-RAS.ipynb
\`\`\`

4. Follow the instructions in the notebook to load your data, explore visualizations, and generate predictions using machine learning models.
